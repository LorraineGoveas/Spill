# Getting started with MERN

## Install dependencies
  * Requires [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#using-a-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm)
  * Requires nvm
		Nvm is not “technically” required, and is the “harder” way to use npm as a beginner. But installing it using the standard Node.js install can lead to permissions errors down the road, so we’re going to do it right the first time.  
  * Check installation according to the README you used to install nvm
  * Run `npm install`
  * [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/installation/)

## Install Create-React-App
  * Run 'npm install -g create-react-app' (might need sudo)
  * 'create-react-app spill'
  * 'cd spill'
  * 'npm start'
